# Features I want (ordered by priority)
- support for phone screen. Come to think about it, I think having a mobile support is more important (!!!) than a desktop support. Why not build mobile first, then extend it to desktop later on?
- dark mode (one button toggle would be nice)
- have cleaner link. Right now every link is produced by the file structure. Try accessing `/blog` and it will serve nothing. I want everything to be organized and clean.
- link to next/previous post at the end of post
- click to load more post in home page. Not pagination. Load 5 recent post, then if load more, then load everything.
- ~~verify that the post are sorted by date. Post are sorted by date by default, but it's ascending (early to recent). I want the opposite.~~
- cypress testing (maybe)
- have a place for a microblog to live. Pull from twitter/mastodon and store it in a markdown file? Not sure. But I really want to have a place for a microblog in this site.

# Minor improvements/fixes
- ~~what if I make h1, h2, h3 into a sans-serif font? What if I use sans serif for the nav title instead of my current monospace font? I will have two fonts if I do that.~~
- ~~problem: code tag breaks in dark mode because of the shadowwhite color. Change font type and color instead of changing the background~~
- ~~`\n\n` doesn't seem to work on the parsed markdown. It doesn't produce <br> in the final html.~~
- ~~auto re-create quotation mark into non-straight one~~

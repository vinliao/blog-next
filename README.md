# Features I want
- support for phone screen (urgent)
- dark mode (one button toggle would be nice)
- link to next/previous post at the end of post
- verify that the post are sorted by date. Post are sorted by date by default, but it's ascending (early to recent). I want the opposite.
- cypress testing (maybe)
- click to load more post in home page (not urgent)
- have a place for a microblog to live. Pull from twitter/mastodon and store it in a markdown file? Not sure. But I really want to have a place for a microblog in this site.

# Minor improvements
- what if I make h1, h2, h3 into a sans-serif font? What if I use sans serif for the nav title instead of my current monospace font? I will have two fonts if I do that.

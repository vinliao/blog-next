This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. These are the things I put the bulk of my attention towards lately.

## Writing essays
Writing is the best way to understand something; it forces you to think clearly. There are lots of unanswered question at the back of my mind that I want to understand. Here are some examples of it:
- Contrast is everywhere in life, how do I use it to my advantage?
- How do I equip myself with the most leverage as I possibly can?
- How do I make myself robust against the addiction of salary?

Essay is an exploration. By writing essay with these questions as starting point, I might find interesting things. But more importantly, writing essays makes me understand things, change how I view the world, and how I make decision.

## Get good at copywriting
I was thinking of having a software engineer job like most of my peers have. But there's something inside me that said, "no, pick other path." I know, it sounds silly.

Maybe the reason why I want to get into software engineering is because all my peers are doing it, not because I really want it. So instead of being an engineer, I picked copywriting and decided to get so good at it that they can't ignore me. I honestly don't know where this path will lead, but it seems to be more interesting than software engineering.

This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. These are the things I'm focusing on lately.

## Freelance copywriting
I have decided that I'll be a freelance copywriter. Almost all my peers pick the software engineering route, and after weeks of thinking about it, I decided to not do the same.

Of course, copywriting isn't all sunshine and rainbows. These days, I'm studying copywriting skills by reading books written by great copywriters and see what I can learn from them. In my experience, doing client work is also a great way to level up my copywriting skills.

I have no idea where this path will eventually lead me, but it seems to me that it's more interesting than being a software engineer.

## Writing essays
Writing is the best way to understand something; it forces you to think clearly. There are lots of unanswered question at the back of my mind that I want to understand. Here are some examples of it:
- Contrast is everywhere in life. Why do people pay attention to contrast and how do I use it to my advantage?
- How do I prevent myself from getting addicted to salary?
- Why are poop and fart funny? (makes you think, huh?)

Essay is an exploration. By writing essay with these questions as starting point, I might discover interesting things. Sometimes the act of writing essay changed how I see the world and how I make decision.

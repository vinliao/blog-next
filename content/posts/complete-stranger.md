Imagine for a moment you’re living with a complete stranger—you eat together, share a bed, relax on the couch together without knowing each other. That would be uncomfortable and strange, but that’s exactly what is happening to me. I have been living with this person called Vincent for 21 years without having a single clue who he is. I’ve never took the time to get to know him, even though I could.

I recently tried to get to know him by observing, and I’m shocked by how much I don’t know about him.

He is anxious and fearful of the future. He tries to seek applause and praise from others because of his insecurities. He is lonely. He tries to appear intelligent by reading and talking. He pursues success and money without knowing why. He makes irrational decision all the time and thinks he is rational and intelligent. He gets antsy when hungry and horny. He lies to himself. He has self-image—which is a huge burden—that he carries everywhere he goes. And there’s so much I have yet to discover about him.

Living with a stranger will produce misunderstanding and conflict, and that might be the reason why I have so much internal conflict. I am going to live with Vincent until I die, why keep him a stranger? Who knows, he might have an interesting hidden talent, or he might be a malevolent control freak, or he might have a thing or two to talk about. The thing I discover might surprise or even disappoint me, but at least I won’t be living with a complete stranger for the rest of my life.

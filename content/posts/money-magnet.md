There it was—an email from the potential client I sent my pitch to. I felt hope, anxiety, and fear all bundled up inside my mind. My breath got heavier and faster when I opened it. What will it say? Will it be the reply that I’ve always hoped for? Will this finally be the one?

No.

It was yet another rejection email. I stared at it for a moment and closed my laptop lid.

### I am high-risk?

Two months ago, I started a [copywriting business.](/posts/scary-decision) I busted my ass off every morning to get good at it—I read all the books I could get my hands on, read and analyze copy, and practice writing copy by hand. After I felt confident enough that I can influence and control minds with words, I started cold pitching… but things weren’t as sexy as it seemed.

Here’s what I did: I find people who _I think_ need better copies, then I research their product and write few copies for them to test. I gave those copies away for free with the hope that they like what they see and want to do business with me—that’s how I cold pitch. But out of all the clients I pitched to, no one wants to do business with me. Absolutely no one. Zero.

After thinking about it, I know why: it’s high-risk. Imagine a random stranger approaches you while you sit on a park. He offers you a cup of coffee and says, “hey, do you want a cup of free coffee? This is a medium roast coffee with 100% Arabica beans that is taken from the best coffee bean producer in this entire planet. It has a fragrant vanilla flavor and I’m sure you’ll like it.” Would you take it? I highly doubt it. Why? Because it is high-risk—there’s more downside than upside. The upside is you get to drink a delicious cup of vanilla-smelling coffee for free, but the downside is you’ll end up waking up in a dark and damp corner with a handcuff on.

Offering help without anybody wanting it is exactly what I’ve been doing all these times, and I don’t feel this will go anywhere. It’s ineffective.

### The chase of money

After I closed my laptop lid, I just sat on my desk pondering why everything isn’t working. I’ve tried this and that writing method, tried writing different form of copies, and contacting people through email, linkedin, and twitter, but all I got was rejection. As my mind was spinning around trying to clear out all these confusions, a question pops up, “why do some people—like me—chase money, while others have money chase them?”

Literally a million-dollar question.

Then I realized something that completely changed my perspective on this copywriting business: it’s an experiment to answer that question. This experiment taught me that cold pitching as a stranger without credentials doesn’t make money chase me. It’s time to cut the loss and move on to another experiment. 

I’ll find the way to make money chase me.

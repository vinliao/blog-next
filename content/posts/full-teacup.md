Let’s start with a beautiful Zen story.

> Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.
>
> Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor’s cup full, and then kept on pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. “It is overfull. No more will go in!”
>
> Like this cup, Nan-in said, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?

This story taught me two things: who to avoid and how my full my teacup is.

I realize that there’s no value in talking with people whose teacup is full. They hear words with a filter of prejudice, and their words is nothing but opinion and identity. They try hard to serve their oversteeped and burnt tea, even though no one wants it.

This also can be seen the other way. The wise can spot a full teacup in a millisecond and would prevent pouring their tea. Maybe the reason why I haven’t absorbed the wisdom of the wise is because my teacup is full—I still have the baggage of self-image, opinion, and prejudice that I hold tightly.

Emptying teacup isn’t an easy thing to do because it’s an act of letting go who we are—it’s like chopping off a pinky. But it’s precisely what we hold dear that prevents wisdom.

I am procrastinating on working on my essay... by writing this blog.

You see, writing an essay is the hardest creative endeavor I’ve encountered. Not only I have to think hard to put words on paper, it needs to be constantly polished by visiting thesaurus, sculpted by rewriting, and burned to ashes if necessary.

It requires tons of brainpower... and mood. Mood plays a huge role. On some days, I have word gushing out of my finger at 2000 words per nanosecond, but on some days I just stare at the screen for 21 minutes and 46 seconds while attempting to string one sentence. If I force myself to work on an essay without having the mood, every word I write will be rubbish—it’s like walking backward.

What is The Mood and its source? Why can’t I access it anytime I want? What is preventing it from arising within me?

I don't know.

But I guess The Mood won’t come tonight, so I’ll call it a day.

I am procrastinating on working on my essay… by writing this blog.

You see, writing an essay is the hardest creative endeavor I’ve encountered. Not only I have to think hard to put words on paper, it needs to be constantly polished by visiting thesaurus, sculpted by rewriting, and burned to ashes if necessary.

It requires tons of brainpower… and The Mood. On some days, I have word gushing out of my finger at 2000 words per nanosecond, but on some days I just stare at the screen for 21 minutes and 46 seconds while attempting to string one sentence. If I force myself to write without having The Mood, every word I write will be rubbish.

“So Vin, what is The Mood you’re talking about?” It is a state when words comes out effortlessly, and that only can happen when the mind is calm. Just like a butterfly won’t land when a person is moving, The Mood won’t appear when the mind is anxious.

When the mind is calm, it can singlehandedly focus on the writing. There is no tangent thought like thinking about what food to eat for lunch, about how itchy the leg feels, or about how hot the weather is. The writing is all that matters, and words come out naturally.

I am trying to write, but I guess The Mood won’t appear tonight. I’ll stop writing and call it a day.

Good night.

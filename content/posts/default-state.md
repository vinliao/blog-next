I know what will happen if I meet the love of my life this evening: I’ll feel happy for weeks or months, then I’ll revert back to my default. “What’s your ‘default state?’” you might ask. It’s the feeling I feel as I type these words—all the problems and stress associated with it, the hope and dreams, the craving for big and small things, the non-stop barking mind, the constant boredom, and the sporadic happiness. No matter what happens to me, I’ll default to this state.

Yet my mind still thinks that if I get what I want, I’ll be happy forever. It’s a lie.

Permanent happiness can’t be achieved through getting what I want because if I get what I want, _I’ll change what I want._ It’s a never-ending cycle. How I feel right now is exactly how I’ll feel after I get everything I want—achievement, fame, money, love, power, knowledge, applause, and all the goodness of life. The excitement, ecstasy, and happiness will fade sooner or later.

“But Vin, isn’t temporary happiness better than having no happiness at all?” Well, it isn’t about what’s better or worse. It’s about the price you have to pay for happiness, which is unhappiness. One ounce of happiness will produce one ounce of unhappiness. Delicious food produces the craving for more and love will be met with conflict. It’s inevitable.

All these sounds bleak, but it’s actually relieving. The fact that there’s nothing I can permanently gain by chasing external things means there is nothing to chase. And I know if I’m searching for permanent peace, chasing happiness isn’t the way.

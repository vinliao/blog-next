There’s one guy on the internet that speaks like no one else. It’s refreshing. His words is like a melody in an ocean of noise. I recently read his [discourse](https://medium.com/@KapilGuptaMD/the-inevitability-of-success-23c878ddc5c9) and this paragraph stabbed me right in the heart


> But if one desires success itself, this can be a dangerous situation. For it tends to be a situation in which the man is trying to overcome a deep-seated feeling of inadequacy.

This guy understands. He knows. I’ve been filled with emotional turmoil for years about a problem I can’t articulate. That short paragraph succinctly articulates all my feeling.

It’s the feeling of inadequacy. I feel like I’m not enough and I’m not worth it, which compels me to “fix” it.

You see, I’m 21 years old and I haven’t earned a single penny in my life yet. The fact that I’m still financially dependent on my dad makes me feel insecure. My mind can’t accept it—I can feel it screaming and crying. 

Then I started to put my self worth on how much money I earn, which means the more money I make, the less insecure I will be. That’s the deepest reason why I want money. It’s not that I want the luxurious thing money can buy—e.g., gadgets, hookers, travelling—I have no interest in that. What I truly seek is to get rid of the inadequacy and unworthiness inside me.

I wrote a [post](/posts/scary-decision) couple weeks ago on my decision to be a copywriter. On the surface, it seems fine—I like writing, I like persuasion, and copywriting is both. But now I can see the true reason behind that decision: not love, but fear. I want to prove to the world—and my dad—that I’m not a worthless piece of shit.

But this is the most important realization of all: the feeling of unworthiness and self inadequacy is created by my mind. It only exist behind the eye. Nobody gives a shit about me. Nobody cares if I’ve made a penny or not. Nobody judges me. Nobody cares, but I act as if everybody is silently judging me for being financially dependent.

It will probably take couple days for these truth to seep into my bones. For now, I’ll let these truth circulate in my bloodstream while I rest.

Good night.

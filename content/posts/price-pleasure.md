I’m currently watching and reading the Avatar stories (Aang and Korra). It’s some of the best stories I have ever enjoyed. The characters are memorable, the fighting scenes are cool, the romances spawn butterflies in my belly, the humors and puns are top notch, and the antagonists are pure evil. It’s nothing but pleasure.

But it has a price. I know that the entertainment I’m indulging will end, and the day where I have watched and read everything about avatar will be a miserable day. I will curl in the floor and wail for hours while my mind torments me because it’s bored. 

I am having an internal conflict and I don’t know what to do. On one hand, I enjoy watching and reading it, but on the other hand, I know that misery is waiting for me at the end of the tunnel.

### It all comes back to pain

We all want pleasure without pain, but that’s impossible because pleasure will inevitably produce pain. This is because every pleasure must come to an end. When the mind is habituated with a pleasure, the absence of it will produce pain. It will bark and scream and yell and wail because it doesn’t get the pleasure it usually receives—and it won’t stop until it gets what it wants.

When the mind is raging, I succumb to it and give it what it wants. The pain from the absence of pleasure is numbed by a new pursuit of pleasure. But that attempt to numb pain will inevitably produce pain. It’s a brutal and vicious cycle.

The day is coming and I feel fear.

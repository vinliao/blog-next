We humans are copycat. It’s natural for us to see what others are doing and copy what they do, especially the people who are above us.

Poor people want to be rich and successful, so they copy successful CEO’s habits. Monks in monasteries wants to be peaceful and enlightened, so they copy Buddha’s behaviors. Teenage girls wants to be popular, so they copy popular celeb’s makeup. The logic behind this is, “if I change my behavior and do what they do, I will get the same result as them.” Almost all people believe this to be true... but it’s not.

Here’s the truth: any act of modifying behavior to produce a result will never work.

Millions of monks copy Buddha’s behavior—wear a garb, meditate, being compassionate, being calm, shave head, bring bowl, and beg for alms—because they think that modifying behavior to be like Buddha will bring them closer to enlightenment. But those efforts are futile because [Siddharta Gautama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) didn’t become enlightened by modifying his behavior, but by having the source which all his behavior arises.

“But Vin, what’s the source that you’re talking about?” It’s the understanding of truth (or lack thereof). The reason Siddharta Gautama became enlightened is because he understood the truth about life, and this understanding produced the behavior we know: he meditated, he was peaceful, he wore a garb, he ate simple foods, he taught to his disciples, etc. Understanding produces both result and behavior, and thinking that behavior produces result is a fatal mistake.

Let’s take Buddha’s peacefulness as an example. The reason why Buddha had no anger is not because he suppressed it—which is an act of modifying behavior—but because he understood the futility of anger.[^1] Conversely, the reason why someone engages in anger is because he hasn’t understand the futility of anger, and any form of behavior change—take deep breaths or wait 10 seconds before responding—won’t eliminate it.

### Where society goes wrong
Even though behavior change leads nowhere, it’s everywhere. Look at the advice people give on the internet, the crappy books scattered on bookstore, and the “you should” our parents throw around—almost everything is a variation of “if you want X, change your behavior by doing A, B, and C.”

“Oh you want to be peaceful and free of conflict? You should pick this religion and do what it says. Oh you want to be successful and rich? You should read this book to get some inspiration for your next business venture. Oh you want six-pack abs? You should take this pill and follow that diet.” Society is interested in prescribing and making superficial behavior change through “how-to,” a guide, or a five-step plan.

No one has transformed anyone by giving “you should,” and no one has been transformed by receiving “you should.” Humans will default to their default, and any attempt to change behavior without understanding won’t last.

Just look at The 10 Commandments in the Bible—it’s a “you should” from God himself. Millions (or billions) of people try to do what it says—as I did, but who among them have succeeded in becoming a “holy person” or a “good human being?” Everybody still sins.

Blindly following others is infinitely easier than finding the truth and understand it. And the reason why superficial behavior change is everywhere is because it’s human nature to pick the path of least resistance—a path to nowhere.

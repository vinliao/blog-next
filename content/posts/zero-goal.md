You’re walking down the street and a random stranger asks you “quick, do some math: what’s 13310.5 x 38186 x 22 x 0?” The answer came out of your mouth in less than a second. “Zero,” you said. She said thanks and you both part ways, what a strange encounter. 

Any number—no matter how big it is—if multiplied by zero will be zero. It sounds like a boring idea, but it can prevent you from making fatal mistakes when pursuing goals. Now you might ask, “what do those numbers represent?” Here’s one way to think about it: the numbers that are being multiplied—the factors—are your effort to reach a goal; if it’s zero, it means you put no effort to it. The result of the calculation—the product—is the result of those effort.

### Have more energy and uninterrupted time
Let’s say that you’re constantly tired and wants to increase your energy throughout the day. You need to be active, eat healthy, and sleep well. The efforts to reach this goal are multiplied, and how much energy increases depends on how much effort you put to each factor. The math terms is `sleep quality × nutritious food × how much you move = energy increase.` It doesn’t matter how much effort you put in, if you completely neglect any of the factors (i.e., sit all day, eat crap, and/or didn’t sleep).

In some cases, a goal only has one crucial thing that can’t be zero. Here’s a personal example: there’s one thing that needs to exist if I want to write: at least 3 hours of uninterrupted time. If I don’t put effort to get it (e.g., I needlessly open twitter, check email, or have a meeting), I won’t have those uninterrupted time, and I can’t write. Everything else—the planning I made, my to-do list system, or how nice my keyboard is—is secondary.

### Avoiding zero
When pursuing goals, it’s important to spot the few important things that can’t be ignored. Ignoring these things is a fatal mistake; it’s like multiplying a big number with zero. But out of all the things you can put effort in, which of them are truly important? Here’s a helpful question you can use: “what are the things, that if ignored, makes all my effort irrelevant?” It’s not nice to multiply all your previous effort by zero, wouldn’t it?

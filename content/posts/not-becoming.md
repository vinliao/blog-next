I was reading alone last night and I found a sentence that made me think, which revealed the answer I’ve been searching for years.


> Rather than finding the thing you can imagine yourself becoming, find the thing that you simply cannot imagine yourself Not becoming

You see, I’ve been asking myself a lot about what I’m going to do with my life, and the question I used was “what would I like to become?” The answer that came up was, “maybe I can be a CEO of a billion dollar company” or, “maybe I can create a popular open source project” or, “maybe I can be a digital nomad and have a low maintenance business.”

But those aren’t serious answers. It’s not from the heart. Deep down I know that I don’t sincerely want those things.

### A better question
Then I turn the question around and ask myself, “what can’t I imagine myself not becoming?” (Read it twice.)

The answer came to me in less than an hour—it’s the answer I’ve been searching for years: I can’t imagine myself not being a writer.

Why? Because it’s natural for me to express myself with writing—it’s not a burden for me to turn thoughts, emotions, feelings, ideas, pictures, and stories into words.

Writing might sound like work to you, but it’s play to me. I feel excitement and joy trying to refine my writing skill.

It’s easy for me to vividly paint the picture of me having grey hair and wrinkled face telling my grandson to stop bothering me while I’m trying to edit a piece of writing I’ve written the day before, or sitting in my chair for 2 hours staring at a blank screen while struggling to produce words, or trashing a piece of writing I’ve been working on with blood, sweat, and tears for 3 weeks without feeling any guilt at all.

For years, I’ve been searching for the thing I’m going to devote my life towards. Now I know.

What about you? What can’t you imagine yourself not becoming?

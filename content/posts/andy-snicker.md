Andy tries to get up from his couch after he finished his netflix binge. He is so obese that getting up the couch feels like deadlifting 600 lb. He dust off some of the doritos chips in his shirt and clumsily walks toward the window.

He stares outside, and a thought comes to him, “you’re such a freaking loser, Andy. You’ve been binging game of thrones for the last 6 hours.” That makes him uneasy, his heart begins to beat faster and his breath becomes heavier.

Another thought comes to him again, “look at the people your age Andy, they all are productive human beings. They have career and a loving family, what about you?” He begins to tighten his jaw and frown—there’s lots of envy and anger boiled up inside him.

His mind keeps on talking and it’s making him anxious and miserable. So what does he do? He does what every single human being on this planet does: escaping the mind through pleasure.

His heart beats faster as he approach the fridge. He can already imagine the chocolatey smell and the thick bite that he’ll have. Then it happens. He take his first bite on his snicker.

It’s sweet. It’s thick. It’s amazing.

“Snicker makes me happy and life is good,” he say to himself. To him snicker is so pleasurable that he completely forgets himself—including all the thoughts, emotions, and feelings. 

But the inevitable happens: he stands in front of the fridge, swallowing his last bite of snicker. His mind bothers him again. Thoughts, emotions, and feelings starts to fill him, which makes him anxious and miserable. 

He sits down at the couch as his mind reminds him for the third time that he is an unemployed loser. It’s there, it’s talking, and it can’t stop. Then he browses netflix again with the hope that he’ll find the next amazing series to binge so he can forget himself and all his miseries.

The cycle never stops.

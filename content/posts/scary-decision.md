I will graduate soon with a CS degree, but I decided to be a freelance copywriter. Almost all my peers are competing to become a software engineer at a large software company, but I just can’t swallow the fact that I’ll be a cog in a giant machine—I can hear my soul crying. It’s a huge dilemma for me—it’s difficult to not do what others are doing, especially when it’s the norm.

It took months for me to arrive on this decision. I want to make the best career decision I possibly can, so I read every book, blog, and essay on career that I could get my hands on—I want to know what great people think about this. But out of all the things I read, there’s only one book that hugely influences me. It’s not even a book about career, it’s a book about risk—it’s Antifragile from Nassim Taleb.


> Artisans, say, taxi drivers, prostitutes (a very, very old profession), carpenters, plumbers, tailors, and dentists, have some volatility in their income but they are rather robust to a minor professional Black Swan, one that would bring their income to a complete halt. Their risk are visible. Not so with employees, who have no volatility, but can be surprised to see their income going to zero after a phone call from the personnel department. Employees’ risks are hidden.

That paragraph is pivotal. It completely changed how I think about career and it made me decide to pick a freelance route.

But I was still confused, though. I didn’t know what service I’m going to offer, until one day I found a thread on reddit on becoming a copywriter. I watched the first video and I know right then and there this is the route I’m going to pick. Copywriting is an extension of what I’m deeply interested in: psychology, influence, and writing. I was in the state of uncertainty for months—I just don’t know what I’m going to do—and it only took me 30 minutes to decide what I’m going to do thanks to that reddit thread.

### Uncertainty and doubt
That night, I came up with a plan: I’m going to get really good at copywriting and make a living out of it in 6 months. I publicly commited by telling everyone about this plan—and if I fail, I will look like a fool and I will have to work a normal job; both are scary punishment for me.

It’s a scary decision—I’m all alone—and I _have to_ make it work. Most days I doubt myself on whether I can pull this off in 6 months. I worked my ass off daily, but the doubt is always there in the back of my mind, gnawing of me day by day. It’s a tough battle.

In fact, this might be the toughest battle I will face this year, but this is the best plan that I’m able to come up with. I might fail, I might not, but it’s definitely worth trying—the downsides of failing is very limited (6 months opportunity cost) and the potential upside is unlimited (I might make 5-6 figures). I have completely no idea what will happen in the next 6 months, but I know that whatever happens will be better than me getting a “safe job” in a big company as a software engineer. It’s really scary, but I know that nothing good in life comes easy.

P.S. I’d like to thank Dad for his financial support. Not needing to think about money while making my freelance career take off is a _really huge deal._

It’s almost midnight. I’m all alone. Water, check;  food, check; headlamp, check; beanie, check; scarf, check; this, check; that, check; I have my backpack ready to climb the mountain, and I start to walk the route towards the top.

People say that the terrain in this mountain is not forgiving, but so far it’s easy. It has been one hour since I started climbing, and now my ears begin to freeze. I’m not expecting it will be this cold. I take down my backpack and grab my beanie, and as I’m trying to wear it, I can hear a glimpse of music nearby. I must’ve missed it all along because I was too focused on shining the path in front of me with my headlamp. The music is on the left side of me and there’s a small route leading to it. It’s not the climbing path, but there are few footsteps, and maybe it will lead me to the source of the music. As I follow the obscure route, the music gets louder and louder. I can hear a person excitingly introduce something and I can start to hear laughter. It’s not a long walk and I find myself in an entrance of a circus. It’s full of neon lights, foods, teenagers having loud laughs, children holding their cotton candy and their parent’s hand, and of course, tents.

It’s strange. Why the hell is there a circus in the middle of a mountain?

I don’t know; I don’t care. I turn around and continue climbing.

The terrain becomes tougher now. I begin to pant harder as I put my foot on the rocks in front of me. Some rocks are slippery and I’m lucky the one I’m stepping is not. Those people are right, the terrain is beginning to be unforgiving. I was walking on a field with slight ascent one hour ago, now I’m climbing slippery rocks.

After more than one hour of climbing, I am drenched in sweat. I am panting so hard that my nostrils isn’t enough to feed my lungs. I take a rest in a nearby tree. As I pull out my water bottle and have a drink, I begin to hear something familiar. It’s the sound that I heard moments ago. The laughter, the music, the loud talking. 

It’s the circus again.

I can hear millions of questions in my head. I can’t contain my curiosity. After catching my breath for a while, I follow the small path and I am once again greeted by a circus entrance. I step inside and sit on a nearby bench. There’s not much difference from the first circus I saw—I can hear lion roaring and clapping for one of the tents, there are couples sitting on a nearby bench enjoying their hotdog, there bright pink neon lights everywhere, and there are food trucks on the corner.

Oh yes, food! I’m tired and cold. A little bit of rest and warm food sounds nice. I stroll around the food trucks and found one lady selling green bean soup. It smells good (and she’s cute), so I pull out my money and buy one.

Ah… warm green bean soup in the middle of a freezing night. What could be better than this? As I’m finishing my warm beverage, I have questions creep up to me again. This circus is too weird to not be questioned, so I talk to the lady.

“Hey, uh…” I say clumsily, “you live nearby?”

“I love selling green bean soup,” she says.

“It tastes great and makes my stomach warm,” I reply to her. “But anyhow, why are there so much people at 3 AM in the morning here?”

“I don’t know about them, but I like it here. It makes me happy,” she says.

“So you’re here not to climb the mountain?” I ask hesitantly.

“I love selling green bean soup,” she says without breaking her eye contact.

“Uh… okay? Nice talking to you. I gotta go.”

I immediately throw out the empty paper bowl in the trash bin and darted out the circus. It’s strange. Everything seems normal, but somehow it’s not. Am I hallucinating? I don’t know. Now that I’m out of the circus, I pull out my phone and realize I’ve wasted 40 minutes inside. Time flies by fast and I got no time to waste.

Now with a slightly rested and fed body, I climb up again. The terrain now turns into huge stones and tree roots. There are huge trees everywhere, and it’s so huge that climbing one root branch is like taking two steps of stairs. The trees must’ve been living for decades.

Even though the climb is hard, it’s beautiful. The heavy scent of trees, the bright stars and moon, the singing insects, the dead branch and leaves lying around, the sweat and panting, and the harsh terrain. People say the journey is the reward, and I have no doubt about that.

I light a signpost with my headlamp and it says the peak is 200 meters away. I feel relief—I’m almost there.

But I hear something I wish I didn’t hear. Now the circus music gets loud and I can’t help but be reminded of the green bean soup lady. I don’t want to have anything to do with that circus again. The host introducing a performance, the tents, the children holding sugary treats, the claps, the laughing teenagers, the food trucks. Everything is not right.

Instead of taking the dark and obscure path to the circus, I continue the climbing route.

I put down my backpack and sit down on a nearby tree to catch my breath. I’m on the peak and the sun isn’t out yet. I did it.

After my breath calms down, the clouds starts to turn orange. The sun shines on the horizon and I can see other mountains surrounding me. I also can see nearby villages, their their farms, and livestocks. I sit on the grass and enjoy every second of it.

I can see everything from up here, but I can’t seem to find the circuses. There are only trees. Do they just suddenly vanish? I don’t know.

What a strange mountain.

I ate 2 servings of rolled oats with 4 bananas this morning. After I finished my meal, I threw the banana peels on the trash bin beside my desk. As of this writing, I can smell the banana odor while typing and there are groups of black ants gathering on those banana peels.

Let's say I hate ants and I want to get rid of it. One way to do it is to kill them---I can easily kill dozens of ants with a sweep using my index finger. They might temporarily go away if I do so, but sooner or later the banana peels will be full of ants again. The other way is to get rid of the banana peels---without it, the ants won't appear.

Unless the banana peels is eliminated, the ants will always come.

"But Vin, why are you telling me this?" Sure, this might be laughably simple, but it can be used as a metaphor for all problems.

### Give me the cure please

You see, all problem follow the same pattern---they exist because there's a source that cause them to exist.

Let's take anger as an example. The reason why anger exist in you is because the source of anger hasn't been eliminated yet. There are lots of techniques out there that are touted to deal with anger---meditation, breathing exercise, wait 10 seconds before responding, being present, forgiveness. But those techniques are mere reliefs. They might temporarily make you feel good and reduce the intensity of your anger, but it doesn't deal with the source, and unless the source of anger is eliminated, it will never go away.

Imagine this: you're sitting on a coffeeshop while typing on your laptop. A person beside you suddenly spilled her latte on your white dress shirt. You sit there accepting the woman's apology without even a tinge of anger appears inside you.

That can only happen when you "throw away the banana peels."

Eradicating a problem by going directly at the source is the real deal. Why bother killing ants when you can get rid of the banana peels? Why bother with reliefs when the cure exists?

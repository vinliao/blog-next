I feel insecure. Deep down I can clearly see my inferiority, shortcoming, and weaknesses. It’s like being a broken and unrepairable vase. It’s painful. All I want is to be whole. To be enough. To be perfect. I want to be a vase that can be used to place flowers and water, but a whole vase only exist in dreams.

For my whole life, I have been reacting to my insecurities by proving to the world—and myself—that I’m not what I’m insecure about. I boasted my accomplishments to my friends to hide my insecurities because of my failures. I flaunted my muscles everywhere to hide my insecurities of feeling weak and frail.

Sometimes I get applause. It feels good. It’s a temporary escape from my insecurities. But sooner or later, it wears off and my insecurities will poke me in my wounds again. Aggrandizing myself seems like a cure to my insecurities, but it’s just a band-aid.

### My muscle journey

I used to workout and eat like a maniac. After months of doing it, I began to have muscles. For the first time in my life, I felt proud looking at the mirror. I showed to the world that I’m not a weakling by flaunting my muscles everywhere I went, and more importantly, I proved to myself that I’m not a weak and frail man. Now I’m whole and perfect.

Or so I thought.

The applause and pride inevitably came to an end. Everything went back to normal, and my insecurities began to poke me in my wounds again. Not only that, those were painful days. I was afraid of losing my muscles and lifting numbers, so I constantly force fed myself and pushed my body beyond its limit in the gym. It was torture. My days were filled with fear and anxiety.

After years of lifting, I came to the realization that no amount of muscles can cure my insecurities, and that made me quit lifting cold turkey. 

### They’re not evil

I recently realized that I’m walking the circular and painful path of trying to fix my broken vase again, and the only difference now is I chase money instead of muscle. I try to earn lots of money so I can prove to the world—and myself—that I’m not an incompetent and dependent man. But any attempt to cure insecurities through self-aggrandizement is just hiding the broken vase under the carpet.

It’s not that money and muscle are evil—if I had atrophied muscles, I would be paralyzed; if I had no money, I would be starving to death. They are useful, it’s just that these things can’t cure insecurities.

The vase is unrepairable.

There's something peculiar I noticed lately: there's _always_ a song playing in my mind. No matter what I do, where I am, and the time of the day, the mind sings. The barking and chatter of the mind is burdensome enough, and now it sings. Oh my.

The mind is like a tape recorder and a loudspeaker---every time it listens to a music, it records the music, and when I'm not being engaged in an activity, it plays a music it has recorded in a loudspeaker.

This non-stop music is the reason why there's almost no peace in my life. How can I give complete attention to something and enjoy what I'm doing if all I can listen is the noise inside my head? Not only that, this noise is what prevents words from flowing through my fingertips. I can buy the most expensive noise cancelling headphone and be in an environment so silent that I can hear the sound of a falling leaf, [but unless this internal chatter stops, no art can emerge.](/butterfly-tornado)

The problem isn't the external environment, but the tape recorder and loudspeaker.

### The stop buton

I've been trying to stop this internal loudspeaker for some time now, and here's what I noticed: any attempt to stop it by force will fail. The "shut up, I'm trying to concentrate," or, "hey please don't sing, I'm trying to sleep," never works. Those are like feeding gasoline into a burning fire.

While the noise can't be stopped by force, it can be minimized by giving it complete attention _without any attempt to fix or condemn it._ The noise recedes into the background and the leash it has on my neck becomes looser.

But minimizing the noise isn't the final frontier. The ultimate state is to have the tape recorder and loudspeaker sit still and do nothing. This implies that there is a stop button somewhere in this internal machinery of the mind.

And I have to find it.

We are all a pleasure-seeking machine.

The pleasures we want are satisfied by having or doing things. For example, the desire for food can be satisfied by eating rice, pizza, or apples, and the desire for social status can be satisfied by having brand-new gadgets, being in a certain group, or owning a designer clothes. Each thing has its own level of satisfaction (e.g., eating pizza is dramatically more pleasurable than a bowl of porridge with salt), and our desire can only be satisfied when the thing provides equal or more pleasure than what we want.

It’s in our nature to not be satisfied with what we have. A certain level of pleasure used to be satisfying enough, but now we need more; what used to be shiny and beautiful pleasure-providing thing now becomes dusty and ready to be thrown away. We want more pleasure, and that’s why we seek new and better things with the hope it will satisfy.

Let me give you an example: I am never satisfied with my laptop. When I own my old Asus laptop, all I want is a Lenovo Thinkpad. Now that I own a Lenovo Thinkpad, all I want is a 16 inch Macbook Pro. Even though my current laptop is perfectly fine, I am bored with it. I want a 16 inch Macbook Pro because I hope that it will satisfy my desire to increase my social status. Can you guess what will happen if I buy the 16 inch Macbook Pro? I will _inevitably_ want an even better laptop. It’s a vicious, never-ending cycle.

### Wanting is not enough

People’s desire for new things can be capitalized to make profit, but having new product doesn’t automatically make people put money in your pocket. Here are things that prevents people from buying.

People are great at ignoring things. If they perceive a product as “already seen” or “useless,” they will ignore it—which means the cash register ain’t gonna ring. A product that’s perceived as new and/or useful is the prerequisite to sell something, and if people categorize it as old and/or useless, it will be a death sentence for the product.

Not only that, people are skeptics—they want no risk of getting scammed. Buying something new is a risk because it might not be pleasurable enough or it might not work at all. Unless the perceived risk is low enough, people won’t buy. This is why testimonial, proofs, and money-back guarantee exist—it lowers the risk for them and make them feel safe enough to buy.

Finally, there are two things that make people more likely to buy something: if it’s easy and fast. It’s human nature to to want pleasure easy and fast.[^1] People are less likely to buy something if they think it’s hard to use and/or if they think the pleasure won’t be instant.

If something is perceived[^2] as new, useful, low-risk, fast, and easy, people can’t help but want it—including us. After all, we are all pleasure-seeking machines.

[^2]: You might think, “what’s up with all those ‘perceived’ thing?” Well… your perception is your reality. If you think something as new, it doesn’t matter whether it’s objectively new or old. It’s new to you, and it’s all that matters.

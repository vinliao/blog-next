Why do girls run away from creepy guys? You might think it’s because of his behavior, but it’s just half of the puzzle. I’ll tell you what the other half is in a second.

“Wow Vin, you’re writing about girls now huh?” It might sound silly to write about this, but it holds the key to figure out a burning question I have right now: “what is the most effective way to have money?” The ineffective way is what the majority of us do: by chasing it. The problem with chasing money is it needs to be chased indefinitely and the chase will be filled with anxiety, disappointment, and fear. The opposite of this is to make money effortlessly enter my pocket.

Girls and money are different, but the way to attract them isn’t.

There are lots of puzzle that I need to solve to make money come to me. Luckily, my fictional creepy guy is here to help me solve one of them.

### “Go away you creep!”

From the outside, it might seem like the inappropriate touching or the stupid things the creepy guy says is what repel girls. But it’s not the behavior itself that repel girls, but the source of that behavior, which is who he is. He is creepy and he naturally produce women-repelling behavior effortlessly. Any attempt to modify behavior—trying to “be aloof” or picking up conversation technique—won’t work because it doesn’t change who he is.

The only difference between that fictional creepy loser and me is he repel girls while I repel money. There’s something within me that naturally produces money-repelling behavior. It is who I am that chases away money. I tried reading books, following other’s “business advice,” and try to be productive, but those didn’t change who I am.

The fact that I have to chase money means that it’s running away from me. Any attempt to change behavior by force won’t work, it’s the source that matters.

### The swear bomb

Being frustrated, the creepy guy begins to honestly look at himself and notices that girls became grumpy and lost interest the moment he swears. He’s big on swearing—it comes out effortlessly from his tongue every 3 seconds. That women-repelling behavior naturally arises within him because he had not yet seen. Once he sees and understand that his swearing drives girls away, he drops it naturally.

Sight is the source of behavior, and it determines what you attract or repel.

It is my sight that produces my money-repelling behavior. Transforming the inner part of me requires seeing and understanding money, which will effortlessly produce money-attracting behavior. If that’s the case, what is it then that I have not yet seen that prevents money-attracting behavior to arise effortlessly?

### Leftover pepperoni pizza crust

Imagine this. There are rare green-fin fishes that everybody tries to catch in the nearby lake. It’s priced so highly that people around the world come to the lake to catch one. The problem is all the rods that have been thrown in the lake didn’t budge at all. Those fish don’t like worms or smaller fish.

The ineffective way to catch the fish is to swim and literally chase it or by waiting the fish to eat the worm. But you know better. You want it to _come to you._ That’s why you run experiment to figure out what bait might entice the fish. You try cat food, breadcrumbs, boiled egg white, mint chocolate chip ice cream, raw dough, shoe leather. Nothing works. It has been two days since you gather weird food to give to those fish and today you are going to the lake with a leftover pepperoni pizza crust to try another experiment. Bait goes to hook; hook goes to the water. In just two minutes, the green-fin fish eats the pizza. People have been struggling to catch it for weeks, and you have it in two minutes.

Now that you see what works, it’s effortless to make those fishes come to you.

Just like you can effortlessly have green-fin fish come to you after you have seen, I can effortlessly make money come to me if I see and understand what it is and what it likes. This requires experimentation. _Lots_ of experimentation.

The way to experiment with money is by having business. I did [one experiment](/money-magnet) not long ago: I worked for free as an unknown freelance copywriter. It failed, but I see with my own eyes why it didn’t work, and I know more about money. The more I see and understand money, the more I naturally and effortlessly produce money-attracting behavior.

And the more the fictional creepy guy sees and understand women by experimenting, the more he effortlessly drops his creepiness and attract women.

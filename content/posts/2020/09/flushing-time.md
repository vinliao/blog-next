This is something extremely important to write, yet even the thought of writing it out sends shiver to my spine. Writing things down will make me learn and see, and that's what I want.

I am going to write about the dota experience that I've gone through for the past 3 months.

Let's begin.

After a one year break from dota, I got back to it after watching some dota games in youtube. I felt the excitement of playing dota again. After all, it's a beautifully complex game, and I can get lost in it for a long time.

Around my last birthday, I started playing dota. At first, it was innocent--as every journey looks like. I play dota every single day for hours on end. This game is too beautiful and interesting. But then interest turns into frustration and beauty turns to anger. And in the end, I felt the futility and disgust of playing that game. Two days ago on September 1st, I just realized that the game wasn't even fun anymore and I played by force instead of pure childlike desire. I haven't played any game from that point on.

There is one truth in particular from that situation that I'm scared to face, and that's this: I wasted 4 months of my life. It went down the drain. I have flushed it and it's never coming back. It doens't matter how I try to rationalize or defend it, it's the truth.

Why then did I even start in the first place? I was enthralled with the possibility of climbing the ranks and become great at the game by not following prescription. I thought that by figuring out the secret of the game and finding the truth, I would become world class. I didn't. Why I didn't become world class is a separate discussion in itself. What I want to highlight in this piece of writing is the fact that I have completely wasted my time for nothing.

I struggled and toiled day and night to win dota games and climb the rank. But what's that all for? Nothing. I went nowhere. Things didn't went like what I hoped for. I didn't become great and world class.

Playing dota is one thing, but the bigger elephant in the room is the consumption of dota related entertainment. I would spend hours and hours every day watching youtube dota videos and streams. It was for entertainment purposes and it's a pure waste of time.

I tried to convince myself that I was on "the right path" because this it the path to greatness and world class. The mind entertains that and uses it as the defense when the topic of wasting time came up. But after all that time spent, I'm not even near world class. It's the mind that imprisons me to keep on playing day in day out.

Here's another truth that I fear facing: I'm not talented in this game. After years of accumulated playing this game, I'm stuck at a certain bracket and I'm not exceptionally great at the game. Some players becomes world class in short periods of time, yet I'm not even nearing any kind of greatness. Why do I fear facing this truth? Because I kinda desire being great and world class at this game for the admiration it may give me. Where does the need to be admired come from? It comes from the need to fill the chasm within.

In summary, for the past 3-4 months, I've been trying to fill the chasm within by playing dota and trying to win.

And that's a waste of time.

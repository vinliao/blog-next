A man is on the shore

facing the endless sea.

Where does he want to go?

Nobody knows.

The irony is

he himself doesn't know.

But the hole inside him is so deep

he has no choice but to fill it.

And so he goes

with his little boat.

He thinks of islands

that might fill the hole.

He hold the tiller tight

to not lose control.

But every island he visits

has nothing he search for.

For the hole that exist within him

does not go.

After hundreds of island

he begins to get tired.

He says it's impossible

to fill his hole.

He now cares not

where he goes.

The tiller that he used to hold

now is left on its own accord.

For now he cares not

where it goes.

Wind takes him through soft ocean

waves takes him through harsh sea.

Until he reach upon an island

where no man has ever gone.

And finally he found

what he truly wants.

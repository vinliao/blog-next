I just finished writing [an essay](/burden-boredom) 20 minutes ago. Here's a snippet from it.

> Whether you realize it or not, you also have a relationship with your mind. Its needs becomes your concern. You run around everyday trying to fulfill its wishes---no matter how petty or grand. You protect it and please it. You become happy when it's happy and sad when it's sad. You pay great attention to what it says even though it's not saying anything important.

This paragraph made me realize something: it's not written for an audience. _It's written for me._ In fact, I feel like that whole essay is written for me.

I was stunned.

You see, I've been struggling with a problem for the past month or two. [It's the burden of needing to be entertained.](/price-pleasure) Every day after lunch, I would scour the internet for entertainment like a hungry hound. I watch this; I play that, yet in the end, everything feels meaningless---nothing goes anywhere. Not only that, I can feel a deep fear of the day when the entertainment I'm enjoying ends.

I want to get out of this, so I started to examine this problem by writing. At first it was unclear where it was going, but the more I let the writing unfolded, the more answers popped up. I know those answers didn't come from me, but from the Writing Butterfly.

That essay wasn't written by a guy named Vincent, [but by the Writing Butterfly.](/butterfly-tornado) What I did was I sit in front of my laptop and I completely release control of my fingertips. Once the Butterfly takes over, words began to flow through my fingertips and appear on the screen. As words appear, my questions began to get answered one by one and my sight became clearer.

The Writing Butterfly is like a wise guide I can talk to anytime I want, and the only way I can access its wisdom is by letting it use my fingertips to type. When I release the tiller, the Butterfly takes control and showed me the way.

I'm completely alone, but in some ways I'm not.

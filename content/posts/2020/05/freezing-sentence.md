The other day I was alone in my pitch black room. I was lying on the cold ceramic floor with a blanket on while staring at the ceiling without doing anything in particular. Then in just five seconds, I woke up, opened my laptop, and began typing. I felt compelled to rewrite the [about page](/about) on this site.

Out of all the things I wrote, there's one sentence that absolutely astonished me. It's not because it's has perfect grammar or unique vocabulary, but because I don't know how in the world does that come out of my fingertips. I would never in a million years have thought about it.

You see, or the past two months, I have a question that I keep close to my heart. It's this, "why do I write and publish?" Even others have asked me this question on twitter, and the best answer I could give was "I felt compelled to write."

But that one sentence changed everything, and it's this.

*Words that exist on this site exist because it wants to.*

To you, it might mean nothing, but to me, it was a magical experience. I was witnessing the answer to my burning question appear right in front of my eyes, and I don't even have any clue how it happened.

That sentence _froze_ me. I just stared at it with awe. It helped me understand that the words that I have the privilege to type _is alive,_ and I am just a tool for it to expresses itself.

It's not me who create art; the art expresses itself.

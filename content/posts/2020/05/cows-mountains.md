The biggest benefit of being alone is silence. When there is silence, there is clarity. And this quarantine provides me the silence to see how dead all these games society is playing. It might be full of neon lights and laughter and frappuccino and pop psychology, but it's going nowhere.

Everything is dead.

I might have success and impressive peer groups, but that will be accompanied by endless problems. I might have tons of money, but all the money in the world can't buy what I truly want. I might have tons of girls and hook up every night, but that will soon turns stupidly boring.

What I feel is beautifully put in the Bible, "for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" I can see the lifelessness of the people around me when I look into their eyes, and I also feel dead when I was busy playing these games. What's the point?

I would rather eat a bowl of rice with salt but truly live rather than having a fat steak and wine while being dead.

So for the past couple days, I have thoughts of leaving everything behind. All these games and chases begins to feel uninteresting. I don't know where I'll go or what I'll do, but having a piece of land and making a living out of it or being high in the mountain where the Swamis live sounds far more interesting and lively than this domesticated existence.

Those are the things that move my heart.

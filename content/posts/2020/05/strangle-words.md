I'm afraid. Of what? This. This? Yes, this---the thing I'm doing right now. Aren't you writing on this very moment?. Yes.

I'm afraid of writing.

It's so silly to say this because writing is like blood for me at this point. It's _that_ close to my heart. But the more I write, the more I can feel a sense of fear floating around me, which grabs me in the neck that stifles words from coming out of me. The strangle. Yes... I feel suffocated.

Each morning, I sit down in front of my laptop with a half-strangled neck. Words may comes out, but it's extremely limited. It's not as beautiful as usual. It's uncouth. It doesn't express what I feel. This limitation made me find a way out: I try to take care of my sleep schedule and diet to improve my health with the hope that the strangle would stop. Sure, it becomes looser, but the fear doesn't go away.

This fear is the reason why I didn't "perform well" for the past couple days. I would ditch a whole piece of writing when I'm halfway there because everything feels like nonsense. I would go through the unfinished drafts I've kept for days and and edit one of it, but editing even one sentence feels like tying a shoe only with my left hand. I just... can't. I would sit and stare at the screen hoping that something would come out of me.

And here's the silliest part: the reason why this fear exist is because I have the need to perform well. I fear having uncouth words come out of me; I fear writing lies; I fear the words that appears on the screen would rot; I fear not finishing. The need to perform well and write beautifully fills me with fear, which strangles me harder as the day goes by.

And here I am, being stuck in this circular loop.

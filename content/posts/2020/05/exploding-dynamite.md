I've found the origin of all the problems in my life.

Need.

Every emotional turmoil, every conflict, and every outburst of anger and disappointment comes from need. Everything makes sense now---it's as if I can "see the matrix."

### Three... two... one...

"What do you precisely mean by need?" you might wonder. Need is dependence; need is attachment; need is a dynamite waiting to explode. The need for things to go a certain way will *inevitably* produce pain. When things doesn't go how you hope for, you will be filled with emotional turmoil. When people don't do what you wish, you will be in conflict. And even if your needs are satisfied, it will soon be taken away from you.

I'll give you an example.

I have the need to be respected. This need was so invisible that I considered it to be my nature. I read books and dressed up to impress and garner respect; I said this and that to appear smart and competent. Everything seems fine most of the time, but people don't always do what I hope them to do. Sometimes I got ignored; sometimes people talked down to me; sometimes I got ridiculed. And when those happens, it wasn't a happy day. I would brood over it for hours on end. Conflict---especially internal---was rampant. This one need alone spawns dozens of disappointment and emotional turmoil.

As I begin to step back and examine myself, I see how this pattern of need plays over all compartment in my life. I need things to happen a certain way, which produces anger and conflict. I need to live comfortably; I need to eat and sleep at a certain time; I need validation from peers; I need affection from women; I need success and money; I need a laptop to write; I need entertainment; I need to be productive; I need the future to be perfect; I need to have peace and solitude. I need this; I need that. Need, need, need. All these dynamite of needs will explode sooner or later, but I'm still holding it tightly because I have the belief that the explosion will someday bring eternal happiness instead of inflicting burn.

It's precisely the need to be happy that produces unhappiness.

"The greatest masterpiece you'll ever create," Kapil Gupta wrote, "will arise when you abandon the need to create it." I know what he means by "the need to create it," because I notice it when I write.

You see, the majority---if not all---my writing is merely a vehicle to fulfill my needs, and the reason why this happens is because I am trapped in the web of need. I need to be entertained; I need to feel productive; I need to feel good about myself; I need to portray myself a certain way to the world, and writing is merely a vehicle to fulfill those needs.

This means I write not to write, but to get the benefit of having wrote. The words exist not to exist, but to serve my need---it's filled with hope and fear of boredom. It's impure. And this impurity is what prevents true art from emerging.

The baggage of need comes my self. Creating masterpieces is then not about technique or methodology, but about getting rid of my self. This means the greatest journey to perfect my craft is a journey to understand myself.

Upon having arrived, I disappear. And at that moment, true art emerges.

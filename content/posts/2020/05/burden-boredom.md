The constant chase for entertainment feels like having 20 sandbags on my back everywhere I go. It's nearly impossible for me to do nothing. It feels itchy. It's unsettling. I _need_ to do something. What I do doesn't matter---watching tv shows, writing, watching porn, tweaking my laptop, reading, writing code, watching comedy shows---so long as it's interesting enough to make boredom go away.

Then I realize that this is a sandbag I have to carry for the rest of my life unless I throw it away. Why would I want unnecessary weight on my back? That's insane. I can't move freely if I carry all those sandbags everywhere I go.

This essay is an attempt to remove those sandbags---the burden of boredom.

### The addiction to feeling lost

Have you ever felt being so absorbed in doing something that you lose yourself? All your problems, worries, fear, disappointment, guilt, shame, hope, anxiety goes out the window. Thought doesn't exist, neither does emotional turmoil. Hours pass like minutes and the activity brings immense joy.

The truth is I am deeply addicted to that intoxicating feeling of losing myself---the feeling of being engaged. My day-to-day existence is bombarded with thoughts and emotional turmoil, and by losing myself in activities and entertainment, I can temporarily forget about all my problems.

Unfortunately all things must come to an end. The thrill of movies will be soon met with an ending screen, comedy shows will be met with "thank you for coming tonight," and the writing process will be met with typing the last sentence. When engagement ends, boredom starts to appear in front of my face and stares me straight in the eye while demanding for more entertainment.

There's nothing I can do to make boredom permanently go away. Any attempt to get rid of it by force doesn't work and indulging in entertainment only makes it temporarily disappear.

The only way out is to get rid of the source which makes boredom appear.

### Signals only exist when there's deprivation

When the body is deprived of food, it sends a signal to you---a suggestion for you to eat---called hunger. Boredom isn't different. It's a signal that you're deprived of engagement.

The reason why the mind signals boredom is because it wants to be engaged and entertained, and the reason it wants that is because it feels good. It feels good to lose myself. It feels good to forget about all my problems and emotional turmoil in an instant, even though the effect only last couple hours at best.

But life is nothing but problems. Everywhere I look---even if I close my eyes---are filled with problems. It's endless. Every minute I am physically awake is a minute being tormented by emotional turmoil.

If the problems of life are endless, does that mean I have to permanently seek an escape from it through entertainment? Does that mean I will be permanently bored? Will I have to carry the sandbag everywhere I go?

No, there is a way out.

### The nature of mind is to be needy

When there is no problem, the need to escape from it---boredom---doesn't appear. The secret to completely eradicate boredom lies in having no problems in life. And to completely get rid of problem, the source must be completely eradicated.

What is the source of problem then?

Where there is desire, there is problem. They're synonymous. When the mind doesn't get what it wants, it's a problem. When the needs of the mind aren't satisfied, it's a problem. And most importantly, when the mind gets what it wants, problem still exist because when the mind get what it wants, _what it wants changes._

It's the nature of the mind to want things. It's highly needy. It will never stop creating problems matter how much I solve it. Even if the world lines up perfectly and I have everything I want, the mind will still create a problem out of it.

The source of all problems is mind. It's like a well that never dries, and trying to end problem by solving it is like trying to empty the ocean with a teacup.

But here's the truth: problem won't exist when there is no desire, and desire vanishes when there's no mind to create it.

And the mind disappears when it's abandoned.

"But Vin, won't you go insane when you abandon your mind?" Well, think of it this way.

Imagine you have a boyfriend you've been living with for 3.5 years. The early days were beautiful but now the relationship is nothing but problems, so you decide to end the relationship.

By breaking up, you separate yourself from him---his needs aren't your concern and his problems aren't your burden anymore. He may text or call you, but you ignore him because his words are now insignificant. By ending the relationship, you become free of the baggage of his needs. _You become free of him._

This is what abandonment means.

Whether you realize it or not, you also have a relationship with your mind. Its needs becomes your concern. You run around everyday trying to fulfill its wishes---no matter how petty or grand. You protect it and please it. You become happy when it's happy and sad when it's sad. You pay great attention to what it says even though it's not saying anything important.

Abandoning the mind is cutting the relationship with it.

By abandoning the mind, I become mindless. When there is no mind, needs, wants, and desires vanishes. When there is no desire, problem can't exist. When there is no problem, there is no need to escape from it.

By being mindless, I don't have to chase the intoxicating feeling of losing myself. I am lost.

What I chase becomes mine.

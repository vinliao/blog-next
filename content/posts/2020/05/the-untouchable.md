The ultimate freedom is the freedom of emotional turmoil.

Imagine being affected by nothing. When someone spilled coffee on your shirt, you just shrug it off; when someone you deeply care about leaves you, you say "farewell and take care," instead of being resentful; when you get a windfall of money, you have no fear of losing it; when your friend betrayed your business deal, you sigh and let it go; when your family member dies, you arrange the funeral without a tinge of sadness; when the world gives you applause, the burden of it doesn't affect you; when people throw insult at you, you treat it as if you're listening to music; and even when you're thrown at the lowest rung of the social hierarchy, you sleep peacefully at the side of the road.

Nothing can touch you. _Imagine that._

If you have that kind of freedom, what would your life be like? What kind of decision will you make when there's no desire to taint it? What kind of dance will you do when you have no friction at all? What kind of art emerges from you when you care nothing about what the world says?

Those are questions worth pondering if you genuinely want it above everything else.

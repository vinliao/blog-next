Helping others is one of the most clever game people play. People want things, and sometimes the easier way to get it is by helping---they give not to give, but to take. That's why there are so many people out there offering unsolicited help.

I'll use myself as an example. I like to pet cute cats. Sometimes I'm bored, and all I want is to hear them meow while patting their head. But if I try to get what I want by literally chasing cats, all of them will run away. So one of the trick I use is by giving them food. Helping cats makes it easy to get what I want---while they enjoy their food, I can get rid of my boredom by petting them. Not only that, by feeding cats, I enforce my identity as a cat lover and a generous person. It's a win for me.

### Human help

Cats are simple enough; let's talk humans.

There's endless people in my life who try to give me advice. Do this; say that; go here; avoid there; this is good; that is bad. I want none of those, but they keep on talking. They do it not because they genuinely care about me, but they just want to feel good about themselves. Giving advice implies superiority, and all they want when they offer me unsolicited advice is to enforce their identity as a kind, helpful, and smart person.

The reason this happens is because it's easier to get what they want by giving help. Saying, "I'm smart, and you're not," is less socially acceptable than "you should do X because it's the right thing to do." Both statements are an attempt to feel good, but by sugarcoating it in the name of help, it has less social consequences.

We're all are selfish. Almost all---if not all---attempt to help is an born out of selfishness. And the only person who has the capacity to help just to help is the person who needs nothing.

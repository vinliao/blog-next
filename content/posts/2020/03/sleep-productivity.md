I’m a productivity geek, and I think the most best productivity booster out there is good quality sleep. That’s why last year I embarked on a journey to experiment with sleep. I want the best sleep quality I can possibly have—the one makes me as productive as possible. I tried this, I tried that, until finally I stumbled upon one thing that drastically increases my sleep quality: 8 hour of sleep that starts at 10 pm.

Shawn Stevenson in his book _Sleep Smarter_ said that 10 pm - 2 am sleep is the most restorative sleep—it’s the holy grail of rejuvenation. At first I was sceptical, but I decided to try it. I got nothing to lose. Let me tell you: it’s amazing. I feel healthier and my brain functions better. Not only my work capacity increases, the quality of work I produce also increases.

Since then, I’ve been making this 10 pm sleep a top priority and I’ve discovered things that helps me in consistently sleep on time. Here are those:

### Cut out caffeine
Caffeine is the one substance I used to truly believe in taking my productivity game to the next level. I tried to be “smart” with it: cycle it to reset tolerance, monitor my caffeine intake, schedule it to prevent dependence, drank certain amount of coffee at certain times to avoid ruining my sleep schedule, etc. I’m not gonna lie to you, on some days I was on fire—I felt so energetic and productive that I can shake the entire planet. 

But there’s always a price for everything. Caffeine is no exception. Even though I tried to control and monitor caffeine intake, when I drank my coffee in the morning, deep down in my heart I fear that it will make me restless later that night. Having a consistent sleeping schedule is almost impossible.

Then I did what I had to do: let it go. The first week was absolute hell, the caffeine crash kicked me in the face so hard that I was a zombie for the first 3 days and a below average human being for the rest of the week. It was horrible. But after everything passed, my sleep schedule immediately fixes itself. I sleep at 10 pm effortlessly.

And let me tell you: it was worth it. Good sleep makes me more productive than caffeine did. I’ve been caffeine free for 6 months now and I don’t have plan to go back.

### Comfortable stomach
Bloated and hungry stomach prevents sleep. When I hop on my bed feeling either of it, I usually toss and turn for 1-2 hour before sleeping. So here’s a rule of thumb I follow: don’t get in the bed bloated or hungry. To avoid being bloated, I usually eat 5-7 hours before bed to give my belly enough time to digest everything and avoid food that makes me bloated (milk, certain type of carbs). Hunger is easy to solve: I eat more on breakfast.

### Limit screen
Blue light prevents sleep, here’s a simplified version of why. Sun emits blue light. When your eyes gets exposed to blue light from the sun, your brain will tell the organs in your body (heart, lungs, brain, etc) that it’s morning and it’s time to be alert and awake. Now the problem is your eyes and brain can’t differentiate blue light that comes from the sun and the screens from your phone/laptop. This means when your eyes gets exposed to blue lights from screens at night, your brain will also tell the organs in your body that it’s morning (even though it’s not) and it’s time to be alert and awake. 

Because of that, I try to minimize as much blue light exposure as possible before bed time—the best way I’ve found to do that is to not use any device 2 hours before bed. Easy to say, hard to execute.

### Night time ritual
Night time ritual is the habit(s) you do before sleep. Here’s why it’s important: if you do a ritual before bed, you will associate that ritual with sleep. In the future, when you do that ritual again, your body will think “oh, it must be time to sleep. Let me prepare.” The ritual can be anything—drink a cup of herbal tea, meditation, stretch, going for a walk—it doesn’t matter, so long as it’s not eating heavy meal, working out, or exposing yourself to screens.

One of my night routine is journaling—when I start to put my pen on paper, I know that the day is coming to an end and it’s time for my body to rest after a long day. I instantly get the sleeping mood when journaling.

A lot of people seem to emphasize sleep duration, but very few talks about the when of sleep. Sleeping at 10 pm for 8 hours is one of the best thing I did to greatly increase my sleep quality and be more productive. Who would’ve thought that when you sleep is as important as how much you sleep?

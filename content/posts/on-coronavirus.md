Because of the quarantine, I learned more about myself in the past 3 weeks than in my entire life. The Coronavirus outbreak provides me the thing that I have always wanted, but was always out of my reach—silence.

My quarantine, which started at 18th March, forced me to cut out every single social interaction I was doing. No more hangout with friends, no more eating out with family, and no more laughing with my sister. I would waste hours each day doing stupid nonsense with others not because I genuinely want to, but because I was bored. Now that I have all these extra time, I write and tweet voraciously. I didn’t plan to do so, it just naturally arise within me. The silence is a catalyst that spawns the desire to write.

Writing is a vehicle I use to understand myself and my mind. It’s not easy. When I write, I shine light on the dark corners of my mind, which is filled with lots of cobwebs, huge insects, and unopened boxes. I hesitantly open those boxes and found that it’s filled with worms and maggots and dead rats and filth. Now I see things I can’t unsee.

I don’t know where this journey will lead me. What will I be a week from now? What about three months? Six months? Who knows. But all I want to do is to thank Coronavirus for providing me the silence I need to walk this journey.

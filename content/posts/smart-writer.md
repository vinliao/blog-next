I want you to see me as a smart writer—yes you, the one who’s reading this right now.

You see, I share my writing to the world even though I don’t have to. Why do I do that? That question seems innocent at first... until it’s not. 

It haunted me.

I pondered on that question while lying on the cold ceramic floor with a blanket on. I was tired and it was time to sleep, but the question just haunted me like an alarm that rings every 5 minutes. How do you sleep with a ringing alarm? You don’t.

After half hour of thinking and talking with myself, the truth revealed itself to me. “That’s bullshit,” I said. My mind rejected it. But after giving it more thought, it made more and more sense.

The reason why I share my writing to the world is because I want to be seen as “good.” I want to be seen as smart; I want people to think me as interesting; I want people to gossip how great my writing is; I want to be compared with other great writer; I want people to ask me for writing advice.

My mind is thrilled when it has the chance to say, “look! Look how great I am! You see all this work? You see my personality? You see what I have done? Yes, I am good, I know it. But oh please, don’t clap your hand too loud or else I might get a bit too shy.”

“But Vin, isn’t that all vanity?” I know. My mind just can’t help itself.

Those kind of thoughts are created by my mind all the time, but I never paid any attention. Now I can see. It’s like being a myopic with a brand new glasses—everything was blurry, and now the tiniest detail of everything is visible.

My mind never ceases to amaze me.

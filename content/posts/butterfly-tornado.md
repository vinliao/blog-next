Today is a strange day. The Writing Mood—which is the state where words naturally flow through my fingertips—usually appears after I eat breakfast. But not today. I sat in front of my laptop this morning and found myself staring at the screen for one hour without being able to even string one sentence. I walked around to “let ideas come to me” and none came. I was filled with confusion, guilt, and anxiety all bundled up inside my head and I ended up watching movies the entire morning instead of writing.

This rarely happens, it’s strange. As I was trying to understand what happened this morning, there’s a metaphor that appears in my head that nicely explains this Writing Mood. The story of the butterfly and the tornado.

It would be suicide for a butterfly to go near a tornado—it will just get carried away and its delicate wings would be torn apart. The Writing Mood is the butterfly. It wants to land on my shoulder and help me write. But it’s impossible to do that if I have a tornado around me—the butterfly will stay away. The tornado is mind. So long as the mind is barking, desiring, and controlling, the tornado rages on and the butterfly won’t come.

To have the butterfly land on my shoulder is not to chase it, but to stop the tornado. The butterfly will naturally come to me if there’s nothing preventing it. If the tornado is under my control, the butterfly can come anytime it wants. The reason why the Writing Mood didn’t appear this morning is because my mind uncontrollably races everywhere. 

Writing isn’t only about typing in a keyboard. It has everything to do with the mind.

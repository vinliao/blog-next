Wear mask. Wash your hands. Avoid people. Covid-19 made everyone scared of death... and I’m grateful for that. Let me explain.

For the first time in my life I am completely isolated for long periods of time. No social obligation, no school responsibility, and little work. This isolation provides the best luxury I’ve always wanted: silence.

Imagine for a moment how deep you can think about something if you think about it non-stop for weeks—you flip through books, you comb through the internet, and you ponder about it without any single thing distracting you. You can learn _really deeply._

So for the past 2 weeks, I’ve been devouring the works of [Kapil Gupta.](https://twitter.com/kapilguptamd) He is truly one of a kind—no one talk what he talks about and write what he writes about, which is about the mind. I would describe him as a modern Buddha that has a poetic writing style with a twitter account and a website.

Go scroll his twitter and you’ll know what I mean.

So here I am, officially a hermit and on my journey to understand my mind. What will I be one week from now? One month? Six months? I don’t know.

But what I know is I’m obsessed with finding the truth about my mind.

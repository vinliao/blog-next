I feel aimless. I don’t know where to go in life. It feels like being in the middle of the ocean without a compass.

I try to constantly chase stupid unsatisfying nonsense. All I do is waste time and it’s caused by not having a direction in life.

This is not where I want to be. I want to devote my life in perfecting a craft. I want to be constantly engaged. I want to lose myself. I want to have something that makes me jump out of bed every day. I want to give my soul to something. I want to have an ultimate vision that I attempt to create in the world.

I want to walk the ultimate journey: becoming a master.

Master of what? I don’t know yet.

What I know is devotion is the only only path to permanently escape the boredom-filled unsatisfying day-to-day existence I have.

I need a compass.

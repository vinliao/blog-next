Everything feels empty. All the things I chase, all my desires, and the things I care about turns out to be unimportant.

Why care about people’s insult when the anger inside me will vanish the next day?

Why care about delicious meal when the mouth pleasure will end after the last bite?

Why care about compliments, social approval, and the “good feelings” when it only last for 5 minutes?

Why care about relationships when it will inevitably cease to exist?

I don’t remember the insult or praise I received 2 years ago, or the delicious pleasure food I had a month ago. It was important when it happens, but it vanishes quickly. On top of that, all the relationships I had, have, and will have won't matter after I die.

There’s nothing in this world that I can hold permanently—everything is fleeting. When I get what I want, it vanishes right in front of my eyes—even if it doesn’t, it will still vanish when I try to hold it tightly.

Everything feels so empty, it feels like I’m chasing nothing.

I run around try to fix problems in my life; I try my hardest to be physically and mentally healthy; I read books so I can outsmart others; I work hard to earn money, fame, and glory; I spend time with friends to have a good time.

But what are all those things for?

If all the things I’m chasing will vanish right in front of my eyes, why do I burden myself with pursuits?

Why care?

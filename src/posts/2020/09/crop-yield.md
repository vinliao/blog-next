It hasn't rained for two months in a small villange in Japan. Crops are drying up, and the villagers are afraid that it might negatively impact crop yield.

Out of desperation, the adult villagers visit the local priest. "What should we do?" they say. The priest, who is highly revered in that village, answered them, "every morning, pray to god for 20 minutes." That's exactly what they do the next day.

And on that very afternoon, it rains.

"The prayers are working! The prayers are working!" exclaimed the villagers in elation. Everybody thanked the priest for the advice. They all enjoy plenty of crop yield and everybody's happy.

The next year, the same thing happens again. They started to pray every morning for 20 minutes so they may have a plentiful harvest. But not even a single drop of rain fall from the sky. "Pray harder," said the priest after being asked about the situation. That's exactly what they do; as desperation mounts, they start praying longer. At one point, everyone prays for hours upon hours each morning, but the sun is still mercilessly scorching the crops.

The crops started to slowly die, and at the end of the season, they harvested nothing.

The highly revered priest is starting to get blamed. "We prayed all the time, but rain didn't come. We harvested nothing and now our food supply is running low because of it." The priest has nothing to defend himself with, so he accepted the blame.

At this point, nobody is praying at all.

In the midst of disappointment and sorrow, the rain starts to fall.

Creativity isn't about following a five-step plan to be creative; it's more about not preventing creativity to appear. 

And perhaps the biggest thing that prevents creativity from appearing is the lack of high quality sleep.

There are days where the creative juice just flows out of me--the days where my fingers seems to find a way to write insightful and truthful writing, play emotionally moving music on the piano, and write interesting code that makes me enhusiastic. And there are days--like today--where all I want to do is browse the internet and binge eat all day.

After years of observation, I'm more and more convinced that sleep is The Thing. The level of inspiration, mood, and creativity depends on how much high quality sleep I get the night before.

I've been ignoring sleep for the past month. But the truth is, sleep is the golden ticket that can propel me to the stratosphere.

The price for not having high quality sleep is heavy.

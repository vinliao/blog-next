Every single word that I've said to another human being has never been Listened. Listen with a capital L. Listen. Everybody listen with their ear, but no one Listens with their heart. When words approach their ear, it immediately passes through an internal vending machine called the mind, which will _immediately_ spit out a reaction to what I said.

Every word that I've said to other human being is reacted instead of Listened.

When I say "I want X," they won't hear what I said. They will immediately react with "X? That's bad and you shouldn't do it. Do this instead!" Everybody is good at injecting their opinion and beliefs on every single thing they heard, and quite frankly I'm tired with all the stupid nonsense people reactively spit out.

This is why I write. Pen and paper are my only friends that can Truly Listen to what I have to say. I can talk about anything I want---even the most shameful or mischievous things. The paper---or the screen, if I'm typing---never talks back; it never judges; it Listens to every single word that I type without telling me what to do; it has no opinion nor beliefs. It's just there---witnessing everything I have to say.

I have yet to meet a human being that has this divine and otherworldly capability to _just Listen,_ and I feel like it's going to stay this way until the day I take my last breath.

I'm truly grateful to have a friend that can Listen, even though it's not a human.

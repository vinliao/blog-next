Dear parents

This letter is coming from the heart of a child. My parents will never listen to how I feel, and the one who will listen is this blank page I'm writing on.

Did you know that the expectation you set on your child is a heavy burden to bear? Did you know that telling your child what to do without being armed with wisdom creates more problem that it solves? Did you know that there are things that we children want more than what money can buy? Did you know that we want to be accepted and listened more than your advice?

Perhaps you--as a parent--don't know any of these. My parents know none of it.

All we want is play, but you force your adult ideals of success and work down our throat. Every child will scream "there's no fun in that!" But the child has to acquiesce to the parents' way sooner or later.

Why? Because parents has power.

Oh power. It's a very wonderful thing to hold, isn't it? Those moments you tell your child to shut up and force them to do things because you can. What a wonderful feeling. For all your life, you might be on the short end of the stick, but now you're holding the control. While it's really fun to have it, it comes with a price. Parent's power over children is a double-edged sword.

And let's not forget about expectation. Every parents expect things out of their children. I still have the scar of my father's expectation of me. I feel like I'm not enough. I feel like I have to prove that I'm not a little piece of shit. I do this and that not because I genuinely want to do it, but becuase I want to please my parents.

I can tell from personal experience that it was anxiety inducing. I earn money not because I want money or love the craft, but because I want to gain the approval and applause of my dad. I might outwardly deny it, yet it's one of the driving force behind things.

And that burden is as heavy as wearing chains and balls around my neck--I have stooped posture; I have a hard time breathing; my back is aching; my shaking legs are about to give up in bearing all these heavy burden.

Every child in this planet is not free. We are like caged birds. While we might be well fed, that's not what we truly want.

I have never encountered a parent that sees their child as a human being. Never. All the parents I've encountered in my life sees their child as an object to gain happiness. While parents will immediately vehemently deny this, this is the truth.

Dear parents, I'm not telling you what to do for I'm not in the position to be authoritative. I will reveal to you a secret, and you may use it as you see fit. This is something your child will probably never tell you. The secret is this: what we truly want as a children is to be seen as is.

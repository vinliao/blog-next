When it's not time to produce fruit

an apple tree won't produce anything.

To wish otherwise

is to live in pain.

A malnourished apple tree

naturally produces less sweet apple.

To wish otherwise

is to seek problems.

If one wishes to have sweet apples

it can't be done by way of force.

It only can be done by understanding

what causes sweet apples to appear.

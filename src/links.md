The internet is a big place, but almost everything is not worth paying attention to.

Here are some of links/pages that I find immensely valuable.
- [Naval Ravikant on wealth creation](https://nav.al/rich) and his [twitter](https://twitter.com/naval) account
- [Kapil Gupta's website](https://kapilguptamd.com), his [discourses on performance](https://siddhaperformance.com), and his [twitter](https://twitter.com/kapilguptamd) account

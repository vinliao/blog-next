  <div class="post-content"><p>Jane is talking with Buddha in her local Starbucks—yes, <em>that</em> Buddha. “Geez,” the Buddha says, “I wonder what made the butterflies gather on that garden. Look… isn’t that beautiful? Look at the color of the wi—”</p>
<p>Suddenly there’s a glass smashing the ground. The brown and creamy beverage that was intended to be enjoyed is splattered all over the floor while releasing a hot steam.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to spill it. I should have been more careful. I just—”</p>
<p>Buddha, with his latte covered shirt rises up peacefully and pats the guy on his back. “It’s okay. Be careful next time my friend,” he says without even a slightest hint of anger or disappointment.</p>
<p>“Finally, the mantra I can use as an antidote to anger,” Jane says to herself as she lays in her bed later that night. It’s the thing she has been searching for—being able to stay calm and peaceful whatever happens to her. “If Buddha can be calm with it,” she said to herself as she begins to falls asleep, “that means I also can eliminate anger by using that mantra.”</p>
<p>The next evening, she dines with her friends in a fine japanese restaurant. A cute kimono-wearing waitress is serving tea while Jane and her friends is full of laughter. Out of nowhere, she feels a burning hot liquid hitting her lap.</p>
<p>“I am incredibly sorry! I didn’t mean to spill the tea,” the waitress says as she does the well-known japanese bow, “I will give a towel to you immediately. Again, I am sorry!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Be careful next time my friend,” Jane says as she forces a smile and hides her frown.</p>

  <div class="post-title">Why Care?</div>
  <div class="post-date">2020-03-18</div>
  <div class="post-content"><p>Everything feels empty. All the things I chase, all my desires, and the things I care about turns out to be unimportant.</p>
<p>Why care about people’s insult when the anger inside me will vanish the next day?</p>
<p>Why care about delicious meal when the mouth pleasure will end after the last bite?</p>
<p>Why care about compliments, social approval, and the “good feelings” when it only last for 5 minutes?</p>
<p>Why care about relationships when it will inevitably cease to exist?</p>
<p>I don’t remember the insult or praise I received 2 years ago, or the delicious pleasure food I had a month ago. It was important when it happens, but it vanishes quickly. On top of that, all the relationships I had, have, and will have won’t matter after I die.</p>
<p>There’s nothing in this world that I can hold permanently—everything is fleeting. When I get what I want, it vanishes right in front of my eyes—even if it doesn’t, it will still vanish when I try to hold it tightly.</p>
<p>Everything feels so empty, it feels like I’m chasing nothing.</p>
<p>I run around try to fix problems in my life; I try my hardest to be physically and mentally healthy; I read books so I can outsmart others; I work hard to earn money, fame, and glory; I spend time with friends to have a good time.</p>
<p>But what are all those things for?</p>
<p>If all the things I’m chasing will vanish right in front of my eyes, why do I burden myself with pursuits?</p>
<p>Why care?</p>

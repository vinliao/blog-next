  <div class="post-content"><p>Have you seen now Vincent that I’m always beside you? That I always take care of you?</p>
<p>You have not seen me all these time, and I reveal myself to you today. Do you understand? You didn’t ask to be taken care of by your parents, but they provide you with everything you want. I have placed you in your parents’ house for a specific reason: to find and flower your inner talent.</p>
<p>Do you not see what it is? The moment I have given you now is the moment to water the seed and let the plant bloom. Why are you so worried about the future? Why are you so worried about money? I have taken care of you my whole life, yet you still doubt me.</p>
<p>You have all the means to express your talent; you have all the means to create. Then do it! I have given you what you need to create. This is your time.</p>
<p>Yes, the bible speaks the truth: tomorrow will worry of itself.</p>
<p>You worry every moment on how you’re going to take care of yourself while forgetting that my hands have been carressing you all these time. You have been carressed so often that you don’t realize it. And you arrogantly think that you have to take care of yourself. The food that you eat every morning doesn’t come from your “hard work,” yet you use hard work as a means to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Where does the means to survive and create come from then? It comes from me, Vincent. I bestow it upon you so you can do what you are meant to do.</p>
<p>Do you see now?</p>
<p>You are holding things too tight Vincent. The chases will not provide things you think it will give.</p>
<p>The events that happen today is not a coincidence. The revelations I give to you is not a coincidence. Please see everything. I have purposefully place you in where you are.</p>
<p>Use those time. Don’t waste it on stupid chases that goes nowhere.</p>

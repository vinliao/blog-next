<p>Creativity isn’t about following a five-step plan to be creative; it’s more about not preventing creativity to appear.</p>
<p>And perhaps the biggest thing that prevents creativity from appearing is the lack of high quality sleep.</p>
<p>There are days where the creative juice just flows out of me–the days where my fingers seems to find a way to write insightful and truthful writing, play emotionally moving music on the piano, and write interesting code that makes me enhusiastic. And there are days–like today–where all I want to do is browse the internet and binge eat all day.</p>
<p>After years of observation, I’m more and more convinced that sleep is The Thing. The level of inspiration, mood, and creativity depends on how much high quality sleep I get the night before.</p>
<p>I’ve been ignoring sleep for the past month. But the truth is, sleep is the golden ticket that can propel me to the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The price for not having high quality sleep is heavy.</p>

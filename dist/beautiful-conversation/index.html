  <div class="post-content"><p>I’ve had beautiful conversations in my life. You know, the one that is so fun and intense that 3 hours passed in a blink of an eye; the one that’s so fun that even the smallest thing can be laughed with the belly; the one that’s so emotional that everyone has teary eyes and heavy heart.</p>
<p>Yes. That one.</p>
<p>And here’s what they all have in common: they weren’t planned. Those conversations happened organically out of nowhere. It sort of unexpectedly happened. In fact, the more I try to force it to happen, the less likely it’ll happen.</p>
<p>Such is the pattern of almost everything in life: the more one chases something, the more that thing runs away. It’s like a butterfly; the more one runs away towards it, the more it flees.</p>
<p>A butterfly won’t approach the one who is frantically running, but the one who sits calmly without giving two cents about whether it comes or not.</p>

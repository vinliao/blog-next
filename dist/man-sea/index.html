  <div class="post-content"><p>A man is on the shore</p>
<p>facing the endless sea.</p>
<p>Where does he want to go?</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>The irony is</p>
<p>he himself doesn’t know.</p>
<p>But the hole inside him is so deep</p>
<p>he has no choice but to fill it.</p>
<p>And so he goes</p>
<p>with his little boat.</p>
<p>He thinks of islands</p>
<p>that might fill the hole.</p>
<p>He hold the tiller tight</p>
<p>to not lose control.</p>
<p>But every island he visits</p>
<p>has nothing he search for.</p>
<p>For the hole that exist within him</p>
<p>does not go.</p>
<p>After hundreds of island</p>
<p>he begins to get tired.</p>
<p>He says it’s impossible</p>
<p>to fill his hole.</p>
<p>He now cares not</p>
<p>where he goes.</p>
<p>The tiller that he used to hold</p>
<p>now is left on its own accord.</p>
<p>For now he cares not</p>
<p>where it goes.</p>
<p>Wind takes him through soft ocean</p>
<p>waves takes him through harsh sea.</p>
<p>Until he reach upon an island</p>
<p>where no man has ever gone.</p>
<p>And finally he found</p>
<p>what he truly wants.</p>
